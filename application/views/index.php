	<p>The world of IT is getting more and more complex to manage every day. From the ever-increasing popularity of Software as a Service (SaaS) offerings to the proliferation of mobile devices, a new way of thinking and managing end-user assets is critical to IT’s future success.</p>
	<p>Matrix42 has joined forces with ServiceNow to provide user self-provisioning capabilities for Mobile Workplace, Virtual Workplace and Physical Workplace Management to assist IT in managing the end users’ needs now and in the future.</p>
	<p>Matrix42 gives end users the flexibility and control they want to stay connected and improve their productivity. And, it actually decreases the burden on IT departments while still letting them set the parameters for users in order to maintain security and compliance. Matrix42 enables users to have transparent access to their data and services everywhere. Users can also request and provision any services from any physical, virtual and mobile devices at any time through the ServiceNow Service Catalog. Automated processes eliminate the need for users to wait for an IT administrator to respond to a request logged through ServiceNow, resulting in quicker fulfillment. When an IT administrator does need to get involved, they can troubleshoot and manage all assets remotely.</p>
